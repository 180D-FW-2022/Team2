This folder contains all the necessary code and files to run the physical
vehicle. The Augmented Reality portion of the project is located in
\Team2\Camera_Stuff.

1. Power on the vehicle by plugging in both USB-A to micro-USB cables into
   the power bank.
2. Connect the Raspberry Pi to the laptop through the laptop's Bluetooth
   interface.
3. Run "Pi.py" on the Raspberry Pi.
4. Run "User.py" on the laptop.
5. There should be a confirmation displayed on the Raspberry Pi's console
   saying "Accepted connection from [MAC Address]" and the webcam feed from
   the laptop should start up.
